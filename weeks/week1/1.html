    <p>
in my life at harvard, there is one annoyance that plagues me
several times a day: opening my door. the problem is twofold:
</p>

<p>first, i am a chronically forgetful person; i often leave my dorm without bringing my key, which presents an annoyance to my roommates/the buidling staff who have to let me in (a situation made even more embarassing on the occasions that i'm coming out of the shower and am... not wearing clothes).
</p>
<p>
second, even when i do take my key with me (which is, in and of itself, an annoyance. how are you supposed to carry 
around a single key? a keyring is overkill. but just carrying it around solo is a recipe for losing it), it's
a hassle to — whenever i want to get into my room — have to put down whatever i'm holding, 
get the key out, open the door slightly, hold it with my shoulder,
bend down to pick up whatever i was holding, and then enter the room.

the most obvious solution to this problem would be, 
as i'm sure you have already begun to consider, to 
tape/prop/otherwise prevent the door from closing.
for security reasons, this is not possible. 
</p>

<p>
another obvious solution would be for me to stop forgetting my 
key. my roommates and i have already tried myriad strategies to do so (e.g.
signage, classical conditioning), all of which have failed.
</p>
<p>
because we live in a dorm, we cannot make any physical alterations 
to the door, locking mechanism, hinges, etc. — so any device 
would have to not only be additive, but would have to be easily uninstalled
at the end of the semester.

    <p>
i propose a kick pattern-activated lock mechanism.
</p>

<p>
it would consist of a vibration sensor placed on the lower third of the 
inside of the door. upon receiving the correct pattern of kicks,
it would trigger a mechanism that would attach to the door handle and pull it downward,
unlocking the door from the inside so that it could be easily pushed open from the outside.
</p>
<p>
a few notes:
</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 10px";>
- so as to not interfere with normal opening of the door, the door-opening mechanism should attach to the handle by a string
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 10px";>
  - having a kick trigger as opposed to hand-knocking trigger is meant to promote hands-free use. if this makes it difficult to gauge patterns accurately, this could be changed to a hand-knock trigger.
